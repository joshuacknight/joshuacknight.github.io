                    Why does an otherwise seemingly effective deterrent for a cyber attack fail? Modern browsers are highly effective at detecting many types of attacks that are likely to take place while a user browses the web. Some attacks are deemed to be with a high enough likely hood of being genuine (e.g. known blacklisted source) that the browser will impede directly and stop the user from continuing. In other circumstances where browsers detect that there is a chance for a false positive they defer to the user to decide whether the situation warrants proceeding. A warning is presented, and the user can choose to proceed “at their own risk” or back out to safety. In these circumstances the users is expected to have more context and understanding regarding the situation with which they browsed to that site, than the browser has. This seems like a reasonable enough conclusion for a software developer to make but it does not always turn out well. This becomes a way in which we can detect an attack with the potential to foil it but instead choose not to do so. And it happens. Long have developers and researchers labored over the correct way to inform a user of the risk they are taking. Researchers suggest that browser warnings are improving but by no means are our problems with phishing attacks or uncertified websites close to finished. </p>

                    One issue researchers suggest might be at play is, warning fatigue. Compared to Aesop’s fables of the boy who cried wolf. Warning fatigue is when frequent actions by a user result in a warnings from the browser, but no ill even takes place. In these cases, a user can become desensitized to similar warning events. Anyone who has owned a computer installed with Windows 7, and experienced the flood of User Access Controls (UAC’s) that could be generated, empathetically understands this concept. This combined with the fact that, the dangers that are present in our networked world are often quite abstract and at time we are detached enough from them that they can begin to seem far away or even implausible. For your average user with only a general technical understanding, so much of what happens during a cyber attack happens on a level that a user never has to understand in order to be able to use a computer in their ideal way (i.e. social media, email, general internet browsing). In this way it is easier for a user to abandon security or trust in some false sense of safety instead of giving actual heed to a warning.

                <p>
                    This is were warnings fail, because while we can detect an attack, and provide a responsive warning, many users fail to understand what the technology their interfacing is doing and thus misjudge the risks of the actions they are taking. This is why passive indicators do not work at all, they are so unobtrusive that there is no reason your average user to need to understand what they mean. Drawing them out into the open more has proven to be more effective. But I believe that users need to be better connected to the potential consequences of the choices they make, rather than the technical details. To your average user the browser’s declaration of a potential man in the middle attack might mean nothing. But if the browser can connect you to the potential result of - your private information potentially being stolen while connected to this site – it becomes a reality even for a non-technical user.
