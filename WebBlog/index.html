                    In the current global situation surrounding the COVID-19 virus, many states including our own (Washington) have put into place measures to limit or restrict public gatherings and asked for people to ‘self-quarantine’ whenever possible, for the health and safety of everyone. This, in our country - which prides itself on its freedoms and individual liberties above much else – has raised some amount of distrustful opposition. To those opposed, one of the arguments against such measures is: how easy it is for a power once exercised by a government to become normalized and used with increasing frequency and liberty. It is the slippery slope principal. Now these are obviously extraordinary circumstances in which we are living currently, and I am not qualified to examine the validity of the COVID-19 quarantine in present terms, but it is interesting to compare the argument; this slippery-slope principal of authoritarian politics, to the idea of function creep in technology. The idea is, that technology very often has the power to exceed the capacities of its initial design. It is among the many talents of humans to repurpose the tools we have at our disposal to other ends. Once a technology is produced its very existence is both “constituted and constitutive” (Jacobsen, 146), that is it exists as a means to dispose of a duty but it also helps to facilitate the ability to do other duties when repurposed or combined with other technologies. So by the very existence of said technology it might become desirable to do something spontaneously new. Biometric technologies of increasing power and sophistication able strip privacy at an astounding level, their capacity to identify and categorize, allows us to achieve a level of assurance, record, tracking that some might find it rightfully imperative we do not allow this ‘creep’ to happen passively.</p>

                    Utilizing (repurposing) technologies for the means to more accurately census and categorizing people has long been a common endeavor for societies. There are numerous historical examples of how this has gone wrong. From the Passbooks used during the South African Apartheid, tattoos used to track Jews and other political ‘hostiles’ in Nazi Germany; racially categorizing people has long been an exclusionary measure taken by societies. Throughout history technology has been used to categorize preferred ‘ideal’ groups of people as ‘citizens’ and ‘non-citizens’. This and other are examples are not explicitly meant to do harm but there is undoubtedly situations where it does. No greater example might be the UNHCR’s decision to begin using biometrics to survey and administer aid to refugees in Afghanistan in 2002. The UNHCR has continued to use advanced biometrics been used at other times in various camps around the world. The biometrics in these situations aid in assuring need based on membership to a list of verified refugees. While this may be necessary to assure identity and stop ‘recycling’ resources, the it is still an imperfect process, and thousands of refugee have been wrongfully denied resources (Jacobsen) when it has failed. Further argument against it is that, given the idea of function creep, be that the mere usage is a potentially powerful erosion to human rights.

                    So before we allow biometric identification technology to creep its way fully into our lives we need to ask ourselves to what end(s) will it serve that we might not intend for now? And are we capable of wielding it ethical? History suggest we may not have that skill and thusly might not be that trustworthy.
