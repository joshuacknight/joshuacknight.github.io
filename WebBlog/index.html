                <p>As we integrate technology more and more into all facets of our lives, technologists, have adopted ethnography as a tool of understanding the needs of cultures of users and the potential usages (and downfalls) of such technology within those cultures. It is in ethnography that technologist seek answers to the age old question “I designed this program to work, it worked in testing, why will it not work now?” But ethnography does not actually promise to provide those answers. Rather ethnography promises to provide insight as to why something may not work for certain groups and in certain situations down the road. By looking at the sociotechnical culture with which we intend to place technology, understanding an environments particular technical infrastructure, culture and expertise. What technologist can use ethnography for is to better anticipate problems and solutions, while breaking down the barriers that hinder adding technical solutions into a new environment. <br></p>
                <p>What technologists want however is concise answers, what will work, how, when, and why. They generally have enough to concern themselves with than to try and garner a deeper understanding of an environment they may only be just passing through. What people who concern themselves with designing in implementing tech would like are the quick and dirty answers to questions like what will work and how do we construct that. And so without the promises of concise answers from field studies, surveys, and market feedback it might be naively impulsive to just suggest that lab studies are the most prudent way of garnering the necessary information to get a project off the ground. But in lab studies alone will only find answers as controlled as our environment itself, impractical for reasonable solutions to what is presented by various fields and industries in the wild.  </p><br>
                <p>So then what is the solutions to the questions of making a perfect system for any particular setting? That is not as simple to answer as it is too ask. There is no particular setting, for a any broadly distributed system with which it should be expected to integrate seamlessly into already existing technical infrastructure and culture. More over what we generally view as a symptom of a poorly designed system – namely why users seems to feel compelled to break or adapt systems for a purpose they were not designed for for -  “is not a fundamental problem to be solved, it is a fundamental phenomenon to be understood” (Dorish). What ethnography can powerfully provide us is not concise answers it is perspective. That perspective can give us insights into the unique needs of technical users, and in turn help us to make better decisions.</p>
