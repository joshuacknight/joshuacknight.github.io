                <p>As a case study, of how technology and culture intertwine there maybe be no better example than that of the boundless growth and change of the internet since its inception in the  1970’s. Originally the ARPANET, the precursor to our modern internet was designed by a close knit group of researchers and technologists. Designed to be open and flexible these design choices aided ingenuity, and creative expansion. In this environment and the commonality of its creators it made it easy for those designers to envision there existing a “common culture” where even within the freedom of the internet there it still maintained a common set of morals. That may have remained true in a world where every user knew every other user this is not a naive dream to envision, but that is no longer the case. When the internet was unleashed on the world in the 1990’s, during the tech boom, it grew beyond what anyone of its initial designers could have imagined. In that expansive environment it did not bring with it a common set of morals. No longer was the internet confined to a common set of likeminded researchers and technologists. It became everyone’s to use.  </p><br>
                <p>The broad generalities, aspects the gave the internet such powerful creative freedoms allowed each user whether wholesome or malicious a great deal of connective power. As a whole the internet has begun to develop its own cultural traits, we can see it in the hive-minds of reddit or other social message boards, where meme culture, viral videos, and doxing are just a small number of phenomenon that would have been incomprehensible to the early designers of the internet. And certainly there is an inherent set of morals you can find among these internet communities, but in the microcosm of the internet its broad generalist nature allows for each individual to have his or her own power of influence, to engage, adapt, and design or steal, hack, or seek to do harm in other ways. At the macro level there are many more powerful individual actors at play. Many powerful economic and political actors utilizing the internet and in doing so shaping its current state and culture. From Facebook and Googles us of big data to target content and advertisements, to political powers like the Russian troll farms or Chinese propagandists, to the United States criminal justice engines searching for wrong doers. The internet has given so much power to individuals who can creatively harness small fractions of its power and so much more to entities that can harness greater swaths of its influence and control. It is hard to envision what the internet of tomorrow might look like, though it is certain to be different in many ways. In its early days the internet was very much a blank canvas, a new page to discover and utilize, as time has gone every actor and every conflict between them regarding the internet has helped to define its borders and paint a clearer image of what the internet is and how it can be used. </p><br>
